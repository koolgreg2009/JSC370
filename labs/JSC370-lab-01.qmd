## Overview

In this lab you will:

- Install/confirm **VS Code**, **Python**, and **Quarto**
- Confirm Quarto can run Python chunks (via Jupyter)
- Render a Quarto document locally
- Upload your .qmd to MarkUs


## What you will submit to MarkUs

- This completed `.qmd` file. Download the [lab .qmd on GitHub](https://github.com/JSC370/JSC370-2026/blob/main/labs/JSC370-lab-01.qmd)
- The rendered HTML output (`JSC370-lab-01.html`)


## 0. Before you start

1. If you do not already have it, install **VS Code**. Then open this file in .
2. In VS Code open the terminal (**Terminal -> New Terminal**). Recall you can toggle between terminals in VS Code. You should see a list of terminals on the bottom right panel.


---

## 1. Quarto

In the terminal, run:

```{bash}
quarto --version
```

If it is not installed, go to the Quarto download page and install for your OS: https://quarto.org/docs/download/. 

After installing, quit and reopen VS Code (so PATH updates), then run quarto --version again.

```{bash}
1.8.26
```

Now install the Quarto extension in VS Code:

1. In VS Code, click the Extensions icon (left sidebar), or press:
    - macOS: Cmd+Shift+X
    - Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+X
2.	Search: Quarto
3.	Install: Quarto (publisher: quarto-dev)
4. You may need to reload VS Code.

Preview this lab in VS Code

Open this .qmd file, then preview it with Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and select Quarto: Preview.

To stop preview: press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the preview.

## 2. Confirm Python is installed

You can try this in terminal:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
python3 --version
```

(If python3 doesn’t work, try python --version in terminal.) Paste the output, but the chunk above should do it for you if installed correctly.


## 3. Install core packages in terminal

Run the following in terminal. It is best to install packages in the terminal (not from inside Quarto).

```{bash}
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter ipykernel plotnine plotly
```

Also install the Jupyter extension in VS Code, similarly to how we installed the Quarto extension above (search for Jupyter).

Confirm Quarto can see Jupyter

```{bash}
quarto check jupyter
```


```{bash}
Quarto 1.8.26
[✓] Checking Python 3 installation....OK
      Version: 3.13.3
      Path: /Users/kevinhu/projects/uoft/jsc370/.venv/bin/python
      Jupyter: 5.9.1
      Kernels: python3

[✓] Checking Jupyter engine render....OK
```


## 4. Verify your Python environment

Run the chunk below. If this fails, double-check that VS Code is using the Python environment where you installed packages.

```{pyodide}
import sys
import pandas as pd

print("Python executable:", sys.executable)
print("pandas version:", pd.__version__)
```

## 5. Your turn: make a plot

Use the `plotnine` library (`ggplot`-like) to make a simple scatterplot. Update the code below:

1. Title must include your name (e.g., `"Penguin bill measurements — Your Name"`).
2. Change the point transparency by setting `alpha` to a new value.


```{pyodide}
from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_point, labs, theme_minimal
from plotnine.data import penguins

(
    ggplot(penguins, aes("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", color="species"))
    + geom_point(alpha=0.3)  
    + labs(title="Penguin bill measurements — Kevin Hu")  
    + theme_minimal()
)
```

## 6. Render '.qmd' to '.html'

In the terminal, make sure you are in the folder containing this file, then run:

```{bash}
quarto render JSC370-lab-01.qmd
```

This should create an HTML file in the same folder, e.g. JSC370-lab-01.html.

Confirm it exists:

```{bash}
ls -l JSC370-lab-01.html
```

Print out the output and make sure it is in this lab. Also open the HTML in your browser to confirm it looks correct.
